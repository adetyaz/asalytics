# Coding Test

- Create page with UI like the image above, you can also check the Figma board for the design [https://www.figma.com/file/LvSfu5VicspNx58c3EK2el/Untitled?node-id=1%3A1174](https://www.figma.com/file/LvSfu5VicspNx58c3EK2el/Untitled?node-id=1%3A1174)

- Connect to GraphQL server. API is located atÂ [https://analytics-api.herokuapp.com/analytics](https://analytics-api.herokuapp.com/analytics)

- Explore API via GraphQL interface, and try to come up with query you should use to fetch needed data. You are to display all ASAs on the UI.

- Would be awesome if you use React (Nextjs), TypeScript and GraphQL client (React Query etc)

- Push your solution to Github, deploy on your favourite Hosting Provider (We use Netlify at ASAlytics) and send the links to hello@asalytics.ai.
